### A Woman Who Made a Mark in History

Khadijah bint Khuwaylid (خديجة بنت خويلد), the first wife of the Prophet Muhammad, was born in Mecca into a merchant family of the Quraysh tribe. After the death of her father in battle, she took over the family business and developed it very quickly. Her caravans became famous and could be found all over the Arabian Peninsula, from Yemen to northern Syria. Even though she was surrounded and advised by her brothers and uncles, it was always she who had the final word and led the family business.

During the time of the Jahiliyyah (before Islam), Khadijah was already a remarkable woman, standing out due to her strength of character, power, and autonomy. Her decision to choose her husband in an era dominated by men and polygamy, in which women had no rights or social status, illustrates this perfectly.

In this regard, historian Bettany Hughes (who also presented the documentary "When the Moors Ruled in Europe") said that “it was her business acumen that would set her on a path that would eventually change the history of the world.” Before changing the history of the world, Khadijah first began by changing the mindsets of those around her, gaining the respect of her fellow countrymen and asserting herself as a powerful woman. She was such a good businesswoman that it was said she could trade dust for gold.

## Early Life and Background
Born into a noble and affluent family of the Quraysh tribe in Mecca, Khadijah was known for her business acumen and integrity. She inherited her father's prosperous trading business and managed it with exceptional skill, earning her the title of "Ameerat-Quraysh" (Princess of Quraysh) and "Al-Tahira" (The Pure One).

## Support for the Prophet and Islam
Khadijah was the first person to embrace Islam after the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) received the first revelation. Her unwavering support and belief in his prophethood were crucial during the challenging early years of Islam. She provided emotional, financial, and moral support, standing by him through persecution and hardships.

## Legacy and Contributions
Khadijah's contributions to Islam are immense. She is remembered for her immense generosity, as she spent her wealth to support the nascent Muslim community. Her home became a place of refuge for new converts facing oppression.

Khadijah passed away in 619 CE, a year known as the "Year of Sorrow" due to the immense grief the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) felt at losing both his beloved wife and his uncle, Abu Talib, in the same year. Her legacy continues to inspire millions, and she holds the honor of being one of the "Mothers of the Believers."

## Muhammad’s First Wife, the First Muslim Woman
 
The caravans needed leaders to guide them, and because she did not like traveling, she hired men for these activities after careful selection processes. These men had to travel around Arabia to sell their products. One of them was Muhammad. At that moment, and without knowing it yet, Khadijah was about to change the world.

Until then, she had refused to marry again and had rejected many suitors, but the young Muhammad caught her attention and admiration for his qualities, which made Khadijah change her mind and propose to him, despite his humble condition. The future Prophet accepted in 595, after obtaining the agreement of his uncle and protector Abū Ṭālib. It should be remembered that Muhammad was an orphan, having lost both his parents.

Khadijah, known for her free spirit, married the young Muhammad. This happened before the revelation. When in 610 Muhammad received the first revelation from the Archangel Gabriel.

In the Islamic tradition, Khadijah is considered and appreciated for the important role she played in supporting the Prophet and his fight against his enemies. In one of the Kutub al-Sittah (original books of compilation of hadith, or sayings and acts attributed to Muhammad), the Sahih Muslim, the following hadith about the Prophet’s wife can be read:

> “Allah granted me no better wife than she: she had faith in my Message when people rejected it. She believed in me when people called me a liar. She shared her wealth to ease my grief when people abandoned me. And she gave me, by the grace of Allah, the progeny that no other wife could give me.”
                                                                   

Today, Khadijah, who is also known as “the mother of the believers,” still holds a special place in the hearts of Muslims, so much so that the year of her death (619) is known as the “Year of Sorrow.”

## Conclusion
Khadijah bint Khuwaylid's life is a testament to the power of faith, resilience, and unwavering support. Her story serves as an enduring reminder of the significant role women have played in the history of Islam and continues to inspire generations to come.
